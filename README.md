# Stripe SQL Query Repository

This repository is a collection of SQL queries designed to extract valuable insights and information from your Stripe data. It's a work in progress and will be continuously updated with new queries and improvements.

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to provide a set of ready-to-use SQL queries that can help businesses understand their Stripe data better. These queries can provide insights into customer behavior, transaction trends, revenue, and more.

## Tech Stack

- **Stripe**: A powerful and flexible payment processing platform. All the data used in these queries is sourced from Stripe.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system. Our Stripe data is stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on Render.
- **Mode**: A comprehensive tool for collaborative data science, from analysis to visualization. We use Mode to run our queries and visualize the results.

## Getting Started

To use these queries, you'll need access to a Stripe account with data, a PostgreSQL database, and optinally a Mode account (if you want to visualize the data). Once you have these set up, you can start running the queries in this repository.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a useful Stripe SQL query that you'd like to share, please feel free to open a pull request.
